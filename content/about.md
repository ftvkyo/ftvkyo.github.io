{{< skills "C++, CUDA, LLVM, CMake, sometimes Rust, TypeScript" >}}

The main focus is development of [SCALE](https://scale-lang.com).
See also the short-paper: [SCALE-Ahead-Of-Time Compilation of CUDA for AMD GPUs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704440.3704782).
Earlier on there was some other work too, e.g. web dev.
