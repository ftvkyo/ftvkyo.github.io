{{< socials >}}

I am a Software Engineer with a diverse skill set and a passion for innovation.
My interests include software architecture, UI/UX design, game development and embedded systems.
My journey in software development has been shaped by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a drive to push the boundaries of what's possible.

My curiosity extends beyond conventional boundaries, as I delve into the intricacies of low-level programming with languages like Rust and C++, while also exploring the nuances of high-level languages like TypeScript and Python.
Through personal projects and professional endeavors, I continually seek to refine my skills in problem-solving, collaboration and organization.

## Work experience

### Software Engineer at Spectral Compute

#### General purpose GPU software solutions

{{< skills "C++, CUDA, LLVM, CMake" >}}

- Implementing library features ranging from high-level APIs to low-level intrinsic functionality involving close communication between CPU and GPU
- Ensuring compatibility of the solutions with open-source projects, extensively testing them and contributing improvements for correctness and reliability
- Feeding into the company discussions, staying up to date with the big picture of the projects and highlighting non-trivial connections between their parts

#### Developing a web interface for custom hardware

{{< skills "TypeScript (Angular, Jasmine & Karma), Node.js, Electron, C++" >}}

- Building a high quality dynamic UI/UX, collaborating with stakeholders to develop a unique design language and achieve the desired look and feel of the product
- Implementing additional ways to process data on the backend which pushed the limits of what's possible and made it easier to use the hardware to its true potential
- Unifying and optimizing the frontend implementation, targeting responsiveness, accessibility and presentation clarity, introcucing tests for the critical UI components

### Software Engineer at Dreams AI

#### Distributed online gaming platform

{{< skills "TypeScript, Node.js, ZeroMQ, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes & Terraform" >}}

- Worked in a team of 10 developing the system from scratch, which included establishment of requirements, designing the platform's architecture and a custom message passing protocol, followed by iterative implementation of the project's parts
- Used advanced correctness and security techniques which included separation of responsibility between components, automatic message validation and exhaustive testing using generated data, as well as fine-tuned collection and presentation of various metrics
- Was a liaison between the developers and the clients, significantly simplifying the project architecture, finding more optimal solutions, and effectively reducing the cost and length of development

#### Extensible fraud detection system for a legacy online gaming platform

{{< skills "Rust, Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana, Python" >}}

- Developed an external isolated validator for high-frequency event streams coming from the online gaming platform, which audited the system, verified the integrity of game results, and provided both computational and financial metrics and alerts
- Helped the client maximize revenue by detecting anomalies, eliminating security breaches and foul play

### C++ Software Engineer at 1C Juniors Developer Centre

{{< geo

## Other activities

I am interested in multiple areas of technology.
I would highlight software architecture, UI/UX, programming language design, game development and embedded systems.
I also pay attention to various approaches to planning and task management, to knowledge management, and even a bit of psychology.

I have multiple personal projects, and here are the most interesting ones:

- [Obsidian ftvkyo](/project/obsidian-ftvkyo/), an Obsidian plugin that accommodates my workflow
- [Tekutonu](/project/tekutonu/), a voxel engine in Rust aimed at learning Vulkan
- [Keymap-gen](/project/keymap-gen/), a generator of keyboard layouts and their reference cards

I also have hobbies outside of tech, they include:

- Photography, Camping & Hiking
- Reading & Writing
- Board games
- Video games such as Factorio, Outer Wilds and Souls-likes

### Leading Student Council's IT department at DIHT, MIPT

{{< geo
