## Other activities

I am interested in multiple areas of technology.
I would highlight software architecture, UI/UX, programming language design, game development and embedded systems.
I also pay attention to various approaches to planning and task management, to knowledge management, and even a bit of psychology.

I have multiple personal projects, and here are the most interesting ones:

- [Obsidian ftvkyo](/project/obsidian-ftvkyo/), an Obsidian plugin that accommodates my workflow
- [Tekutonu](/project/tekutonu/), a voxel engine in Rust aimed at learning Vulkan
- [Keymap-gen](/project/keymap-gen/), a generator of keyboard layouts and their reference cards

I also have hobbies outside of tech, they include:

- Board games
- Video games such as Factorio, Outer Wilds and Souls-likes
