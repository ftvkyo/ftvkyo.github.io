{{< socials >}}

I am a Software Engineer with a diverse skill set and a passion for innovation.
My technical interests include software architecture, UI/UX design, game development and embedded systems.
My journey in software development has been shaped by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a drive to push the boundaries of what's possible.

My curiosity extends beyond conventional boundaries, as I delve into the intricacies of low-level programming with languages like Rust and C++, while also exploring the nuances of high-level languages like TypeScript and Python.
Through personal projects and professional endeavors, I continually seek to refine my skills in problem-solving, collaboration and organization.

## Work experience

### Software Engineer at Spectral Compute

{{< geo
    "August 2021 - present"
    "Edinburgh, United Kingdom"

#### General purpose GPU software solutions

{{< skills "C++, CUDA, LLVM, CMake, CI/CD" >}}

- Implementing library features ranging from high-level APIs to low-level intrinsic functionality involving close communication between CPU and GPU
- Ensuring compatibility of the solutions with open-source projects, extensively testing them and contributing improvements for correctness and reliability
- Feeding into the company discussions, staying up to date with the big picture of the projects and highlighting non-trivial connections between their parts

#### Developing a web interface for custom hardware

{{< skills "TypeScript (Angular, Jasmine & Karma), Node.js, Electron, C++, CI/CD" >}}

- Building a high quality dynamic UI/UX, collaborating with stakeholders to develop a unique design language and achieve the desired look and feel of the product
- Implementing additional ways to process data on the backend which pushed the limits of what's possible and made it easier to use the hardware to its true potential
- Unifying and optimizing the frontend implementation, targeting responsiveness, accessibility and presentation clarity, introcucing tests for the critical UI components

### Software Engineer at Dreams AI

{{< geo
    "October 2019 - July 2021"
    "Hong Kong"
>}}

#### Distributed online gaming platform

{{< skills "TypeScript, Node.js, ZeroMQ, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes & Terraform, CI/CD" >}}

- Worked in a team of 10 developing the system from scratch, which included establishment of requirements, designing the platform's architecture and a custom message passing protocol, followed by iterative implementation of the project's parts
- Used advanced correctness and security techniques which included separation of responsibility between components, automatic message validation and exhaustive testing using generated data, as well as fine-tuned collection and presentation of various metrics
- Was a liaison between the developers and the clients, significantly simplifying the project architecture, finding more optimal solutions, and effectively reducing the cost and length of development

#### Extensible fraud detection system for a legacy online gaming platform

{{< skills "Rust, Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana, Python, CI/CD" >}}

- Developed an external isolated validator for high-frequency event streams coming from the online gaming platform, which audited the system, verified the integrity of game results, and provided both computational and financial metrics and alerts
- Helped the client maximize revenue by detecting anomalies, eliminating security breaches and foul play

### C++ Software Engineer at 1C Juniors Developer Centre

{{< geo
    "June 2019 - September 2019"
    "Moscow, Russia"
>}}

#### Customizable Java application launcher

{{< skills "C++, Java, Java Native Interface, CMake, WinAPI, Linux system calls" >}}

- Created a cross-platform launcher for a Java application, which served as a wrapper and would set up the environment, handle errors in a predictable and user-friendly way, and support Unicode on the majority of possible system configurations
- Documented the project extensively for it to pave the way for better support of Unicode and unusual environments in other applications, the results of the internationalization research included modern C++ solutions and techniques for it, and were added to the company's knowledge base

### Technician at Innovations Laboratory, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology

{{< geo
    "December 2018 - August 2019"
    "Moscow, Russia"
>}}

{{< skills "VMWare ESXi, pfSense, Samba, Clonezilla" >}}

- Set up services to help staff with the education process, such as shared Windows and Linux servers, a network file storage
- Maintained physical and wireless networks in the department, including a virtualized firewall, physical network switches and cables
- Configured the servers, 100+ PCs and associated hardware for optimal running conditions

## Personal projects

### Obsidian ftvkyo

{{< skills "TypeScript (React), Electron, CSS (SASS)" >}}

[Obsidian ftvkyo](/project/obsidian-ftvkyo/) is an Obsidian plugin that accommodates my workflow.
The development process allowed me reflect on the workflow and improve it greatly, and this project helps me achieve a huge productivity boost on a day-to-day basis.

### Tekutonu

{{< skills "Rust, Vulkan (vulkano.rs)" >}}

[Tekutonu](/project/tekutonu/) is a simple voxel engine written in Rust and aimed at learning Vulkan.
It's not the first time I experiment with voxels, and this project in particular is interesting because of the lessons in engine architecture and in development process I learned.

### Keymap-gen

{{< skills "Rust, C, QMK, X Keyboard Config, SVG, Python" >}}

[Keymap-gen](/project/keymap-gen/) is a generator of keyboard layouts and their reference cards.
My keyboard has an irregular shape and a custom firmware, and the OS keyboard layouts are also non-trivial.
This project reduces the burden of configuring that all by hand by providing a unified configuration format that expands into the firmware sources, OS configuration and a nice reference card.

### Other personal projects

I have many more personal projects, they include:
- Full-stack applications
  - *TypeScript (React), Node.js, Electron, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Rust (tokio, async-std), PostgreSQL, Docker*
- Experiments with programming languages
  - *C++ & LLVM, Rust, Scheme and other LISP-likes, TypeScript*
- Small 2D and 3D games
  - *Java & OpenGL, Lua & LÃ–VE, Godot*

## Activities

I also have hobbies outside of tech:

- **Camping & Hiking**: I have a goal of walking the [Pennine Way](https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/pennine-way/) with my friends, and we have walked 90 kilometers of it already (by Feb 2024)
- **Photography**: I love to take photos to preserve memories about places and events, I publish roughly 10% of the photos I take, and my [album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/H7bp4sdnDGMxJViMA) has been going since November 2020
- **Reading & Writing**: I think good publications are very inspiring, and I want to write things that would inspire others in the same way
- **Board games** are a good way to meet other people, while also being interesting purely from the game design perspective
- **Video games** such as Factorio, Outer Wilds and Souls-likes can tell interesting stories and even teach things like patience and strategic thinking

### Leading Student Council's IT department at DIHT, MIPT

{{< geo
    "March 2018 - May 2019"
    "Moscow, Russia"
>}}

{{< skills "Python, Django, FFmpeg" >}}

This was my first big step in the profession.
I got some experience in Project management, Full-stack development and supporting legacy systems.
I also learned soldering and modified and assembled multiple custom door Access Control Systems that used campus cards and integrated with our website.
