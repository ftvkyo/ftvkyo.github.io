## Now

### Software Engineer and an individual contributor at Spectral Compute

{{< skills "C++, CUDA, LLVM, CMake, sometimes Rust, TypeScript" >}}

The main focus is development of [SCALE](https://scale-lang.com).
Earlier on there was some other work too, e.g. web dev.

- HackerNews: [Run CUDA, unmodified, on AMD GPUs][scale-hn] (July 2024)
- Short-paper: [SCALE-Ahead-Of-Time Compilation of CUDA for AMD GPUs][scale-pdf], also available on [[dl.acm.org]][scale-acm] (December 2024)

Learn more about the organisation at the [Edinburgh Hacklab Wiki](https://wiki.ehlab.uk).
I went to [EMF Camp](https://emfcamp.org) 2024 with them and had a great time.

- I made a [milling calculator](/project/milling/) and people seem to use it ðŸŽ‰
- I now also have a personal 3D-printer (Ender 3 V3 SE with Klipper)
