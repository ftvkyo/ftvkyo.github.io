title: "About me"

Hi, it's `ftvkyo` (originally `ftvkyo2011`).
This is my personal website.

I am a software developer.
I like it enough to keep it both as a job and as one of my hobbies.

In terms of approach, I like to focus on system design, reliability and user experience.
At the same time, I am not afraid to make a choice and overcome perfectionism when it's appropriate.

As for the fields of interest in software development, there's actually a lot of them.
I don't mind frontend development (it's so cool to see things come alive), I like backend for how well structured it can be, I am inspired by gamedev and AI, and I am also interested in cloud and embedded systems.

I would be happy to create a game one day that would evoke the same feelings and emotions as the games I love so much (Outer Wilds, Elden Ring, Factorio, Minecraft, etc.).
I spend a lot of time learning something new and practicing my skills to achieve things I want to achieve.

## Other hobbies

The second place for the biggest hobby is shared between photography and reading fiction.
I like taking photos because they are a great way to capture the moment and remember it later.
I like reading because it's a great way to live through somebody's experiences and get inspired.
Also, I am working on my own writing, and reading is a great way to become a better word weaver.

I also like origami and rock climbing, but I don't do them as often as I would like to.
Same applies to drawing.

## Me

Ha ha.
I'll list only a few neutral things -- because your opinion about me should not
be formed based on all the cool positive things I could tell you here :D

My native language is Russian, I also have a good level of English;
nevertheless, I still miss lots of articles and often use Russian grammar.
I am also learning Japanese because it's fun.

I often take photos of some things and write down some other things
because I want to remember them when I grow old. I also like
to analyze past records. Many people self-reflect,
I also do, and I try to do it in a systematic way,
improving my analyzing skills along with a better understanding of the life.
