My name is Andrei (nickname `ftvkyo` or `ftvkyo2011`) and this is my personal website.

## My hobbies

My main hobbies are software development, photography, reading and origami.
I also did some rock climbing (should probably start doing it again).
You can find links to my git and my photos in the [links](/links/) section.

## My work

Well.
Yes.
Software development is not only my hobby, but also is my job.
I am constantly learning something new about how to make fast and reliable software.
I'm also interested in system design.
One day I might also become a game developer because I think creating games is cool.

## My hardware

I have several devices I use in my daily life. They are:

- Laptop (Dell XPS 13 9310);
  <small>
    previously, MacBook Pro 16" late-2019 and Lenovo Thinkpad T480s,
    MSI GP62 2QE, an old Lenovo, an old Toshiba.
  </small>
- PC (Ryzen 7 3700X and RTX 2070 SUPER);
- Phone (just a basic Android smartphone)
- Tablet (iPad Pro 11" 2020)
- Reader (Kindle Oasis)

I mainly use the PC for multimedia content and entertainment.
I usually do most of my programming on the laptop, either for work or hobbies,
to separate working and leisure environments.
The tablet is for drawing and lazy content consumption.

## Software I use

### Operating systems

I, as many people of my age, started with Windows. Back then it was Windows XP
and Widnows 7. I didn't know much about the "magnificent" world of IT,
but I still started earlier than the average.

However, I enjoyed playing some computer games and was curious about how they
and computers work inside. During the 8th year of school,
I created a fan website after my favourite game (of course it was Minecraft).
It might still be online, but there never was any useful content there.
I've warned you.

Here and there, I've learned something by myself and (boom!)
I installed Linux on my laptop in 2014. Around that time I also got
some negative attitude towards Windows as it felt not as _serious_
and _professional_ and _sturdy_ as Linux. Furthermore, in Windows
for many things the GUI was (and I suppose is) the default way of doing things
which felt lame. I don't actually know much about the world of professional
Windows with its Active Directory, Group Policies etc. so I might be wrong.
The Powershell looks interesting though.

I've had this attitude for a while, and it only got stronger when I was dealing
with all the different encodings and WinAPI trying to create
a multi-language Windows Console application.
I can't agree or disagree with "Linux is free only if your time is worthless"
as I haven't figured it out for myself yet, but I like using Windows
for content consumption and Linux for anything IT-related.

### Applications

- Console text editor? `nano`
- GUI text editor/IDE? `vscode`. Big IDEs are dreadful.
- Photos? `Lightroom Classic`
- Music? `Apple Music`. I tried Spotify, Tidal and Youtube Music, but Apple Music is too good in some aspects. (iTunes and their web interface are quite bad, though)
- Video and movies? Online or `VLC`
- Image viewer? That's a weird question, but [ImageGlass][ig]
- Distro? `ArchLinux`
- DE? `sway` seems to be my equilibrium. Tried `xfce4`, `cinnamon`, `openbox`,
  also used `AwesomeWM` for a long time.
- Drawing? `Concepts` and `Procreate`
- Note-taking? `Obsidian`

#### Programming languages

```
My languages are Rust, C++, Python. A bit of TypeScript, Lua, Java and C?
Haskell, OCaml, Erlang and LISPs are also cool but I'm just observing them.
JavaScript suffers from design issues IMO, maybe not as bad as C++ does though.
Award for best design goes to Rust. I don't have many use cases for it though :D
```

## Me

Ha ha.
I'll list only a few neutral things -- because your opinion about me should not
be formed based on all the cool positive things I could tell you here :D

My native language is Russian, I also have a good level of English;
nevertheless, I still miss lots of articles and often use Russian grammar.
Japanese is on my Todo because it's fun.
I've also spent some time learning Mandarin.
Well, I've enjoyed drawing the characters.

My hometown is [Chernogolovka][chg].

I love both dogs (if they are not too small and not too big) and cats.
They are cooler if they are shorthaired though.

I often take photos of some things and write down some other things
because I want to remember them when I grow old. I also like
to analyze past records. Many people self-reflect,
I also do, and I try to do it in a systematic way,
improving my analyzing skills along with a better understanding of the life.

I don't know how much [nerdview][nw]
I have, but I find it interesting to look at some things
from _that_ point of view even in the daily life.
I'd describe it as some kind of neutral 6th sense.
However, it's important not to get carried away.
As an example, this is one of the reasons why I like that gaming/working
separation of my computers, simply, it brings internal satisfaction.
Problems can arise when you are not careful with that,
for example it might be difficult to go on with some projects
because you can't find an "elegant" solution that satisfies your internal nerd.
This is applicable to many things.
Another example is internal aversion towards "bloated" software,
while the term itself is loosely defined, is also one of them.
