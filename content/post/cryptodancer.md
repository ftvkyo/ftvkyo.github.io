  I made another keyboard.
  This time it seems to be actually usable, and has some unique features.

Almost a year ago I made a split keyboard I named Hovert60.
It was a fun project, and I wrote a [couple][hovert60-1] [posts][hovert60-2] about it.
However, I didn't like the end result, so I never actually used it.

There were several issues with Hovert60:
- The keyswitches I used were Kailh Pink, with actuation force of 20g.
  They turned out to be too light to press for me, but I could not easily replace them due to the assembly method I used.
- I didn't like the split aspect of the keyboard that much -- it was annoying to position and move around.
- I didn't like having to deal with bluetooth and with charging the halves.

That whole experience let me understand my preferences better, so eventually I gave in to the temptation to try again.
This is how Cryptodancer was born.
The name does not mean anything.
I chose it because I once accidentally said that referring to the "Crypt of the Necrodancer" game and thought it sounded cool.

My friend Colin from Edinburgh Hacklab recently [wrote a blog post][colin-vt320] using a VT320 terminal, and I decided I should write this post using Cryptodancer.
I need practice :)

## What makes Cryptodancer unique

(knob positioning, functionality and custom event handling)

(fabrication process that involved writing a G-code generator for the CNC router)

(relatively low effort put into design at the initial stage)

(not so unique, but still notable: buzzer)

## Design process

## Farication process

## What could be improved in the design?

## Layout configuration and what's next

(space for Ctrl on both sides)

(limitations of needing Right Alt)

(some combos I didn't position well, e.g. to type `'`)
(and just second layer in general)

(having to tweak sway keybinds)
