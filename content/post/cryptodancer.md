  I made another keyboard.
  This time it seems to be actually usable, and has some unique features.

Almost a year ago I made a split keyboard I named Hovert60.
It was a fun project, and I wrote a couple posts about it.
However, I didn't like the end result, so I never actually used it.

(write what I didn't like)

That experience let me understand my preferences better, so eventually I gave in to the temptation to try again.
This is how Cryptodancer was born.

(why "Cryptodancer")

My friend Colin from Edinburgh Hacklab recently wrote a blog post using a VT320 terminal, and I decided I should commit and write this post using Cryptodancer.
Gotta get used to it!

## What makes Cryptodancer unique

(knob positioning, functionality and custom event handling)

(fabrication process that involved writing a G-code generator for the CNC router)

(relatively low effort put into design at the initial stage)

(not so unique, but still notable: buzzer)

## Design process

## Farication process

## What could be improved in the design?

## Layout configuration and what's next

(space for Ctrl on both sides)

(limitations of needing Right Alt)

(some combos I didn't position well, e.g. to type `'`)
(and just second layer in general)

(having to tweak sway keybinds)
