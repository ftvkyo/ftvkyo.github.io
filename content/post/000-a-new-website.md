Anybody here?

I got this thought to make my website a very long time ago. A classic
idea for a developer, right? However, I could never finish its creation.
For a long time, I had some random pages dangling on my domain.

I always wanted to put something interesting there, and as I never truly
needed a website, I just played with different things abandoning them later.

Only two attempts were notable. One where I made it work, with some pages
and even some interactivity, but it all was weird, as I started trying out
some unrelated ideas. "What if I use Python for boring content serving and Rust
for a quick API?" (not that I needed this API). I managed to make it work,
it was running in Docker for quite a while, but it had zero useful
content and almost no value except the experience I got from it.

Another attempt was less successful. "Docker is boring, I wanna learn DevOps
and put it in Kubernetes". Well, I managed to run k3s on the server, even make
a container inside of it that would assemble other containers according to
their build instructions and then put them inside a container registry that
was running in the same cluster! Wow, that was cool. I also got this website
template working (that you see now). However, by the time I got to
implementing auto-deployment and stuff, I was too tired to continue.

Well, and now, I have finally... just launched that existing template on
Github Pages. Probably, I should learn to build MVP first, haha.

There was Google Analytics enabled, but I've replaced it with
[Plausible.io][pio]. I only need it to see how well my posts
are doing to improve them.


I have some projects in mind, and I'd like to share them with people.
I already have a telegram channel, but I don't want to overload it with too
geeky stuff, so I'll probably leave some more or less technical posts for
this place.

Thanks for reading, Bye!
