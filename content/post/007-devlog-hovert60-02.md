## Overview

In the [previous post](/post/006) -- on the topic, I introcuded my new project: making a personalized mechanical keyboard from scratch.
I described my criteria for the end result and showed you the components I intend to use.

This post is focused on the design aspect of the project.
The posts are sequential, but in reality they go hand-in-hand.
The design influences which components can be used.
Availability, price and properties of the components influence the design.

This interconnection extends past the "preparation" and "design" stages.
In reality, I am in the beginning of the "manufacture" stage now and I still have to make purchases and revisit the design.

This post will cover these stages:

1. Finding inspiration and collecting data
2. Figuring out how to manufacture the parts
3. Learning-by-doing using Autodesk Fusion
4. Iterating on the design until I'm happy
5. Resolving remaining uncertainties


## Where do I even begin?

### What's the shape of my hand?

In the previous post I mentioned a tool called [Cosmos][cosmos].
There is also a type of keyboard called [Dactyl][dactyl].
Both of these things have a common theme: they are made for tweaking, personalization.
So I thought, why don't I try to do the same?

I drew some dots on the joints of my hand (and a few extra ones).
Then I put a ruler on a wall and took some photos of my hand next to the ruler.
To decrease the influence of perspective on the resulting image, I took the photos from afar with high level of zoom.

After I had the photos of various positions of my hand (relaxed, flat, stretched, contracted), I traced the dots I drew into hand shapes and made an SVG with all that stuff.
Thanks to the ruler in the photos, I was able to scale the results quite precisely.

Some fiddling with it later, I tried to estimate the paths that my fingertips should follow when moving.
When I saw the paths, I understood that I don't want to use this approach anymore.
Maybe next time.

### Can I use a laser cutter?

At first I was considering using a sheet of wood or acrylic for the top plate of the keyboard.
Prototyping something with a laser cutter would also be easier than on a CNC router.
So I started by drawing a test pattern to find what size of the holes I should use.

{{< figure src=`/img/007/test-holes.svg` caption=`Holes of different sizes to check laser cutter tolerance. For actual testing, line thickness should be set to "hairline", but I changed it here for better visibility.` >}}

However, as I was about to perform the test, I learned that with the thickness I wanted, neither wood or acrylic would be reliable options.
I could opt-in for a thicker plate and give up the idea of making the key switches click in place, but at that moment, the idea of making the front plate out of metal using a CNC router took over.


## Going with metal

So, I decided to use metal.
As I mentioned in the previous post, my metal of choice is Brass.
However, I still bought some `3mm`-thick sheets of Acrylic and two `1.5mm`-thick plates of 6061 Aluminium for testing.

At this point, the front plate stopped being 2D.
On a laser cutter, you control depth of the cut by changing the speed with which the laser moves.
On a CNC router, you need to care about 3-axial movement of the milling bit.
Additionally, I want my front plate to have features that would not cut fully cut through the stock.

It was time to learn a new tool: Autodesk Fusion.


### Picking up Autodesk Fusion

### It just makes sense

### Additive design approach

### Taking inspiration

### Approaching the finish line

#### Adding other parts

## Remaining uncertainties

### How do I achieve good precision?

...


### Where do I put screw holes?

- not too fragile
- not too stiff

{{< figure src=`/img/007/v29-screw-hole-plan.webp` caption=`Sketch used for positioning screw holes` >}}


### How do I make it rigid?

- How do I make sure the top plate does not slide relative to the bottom plate?
