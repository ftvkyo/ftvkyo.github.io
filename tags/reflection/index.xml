There are many good things about that post.
I reviewed it a few times throughout the year, curious about the changes in my mental state since then and about the goals I had set.
It has also been fun to share it with my friends and acquaintances.
And, most importantly, it presented a good opportunity for reflection at the time of writing.
So, here I am, writing a follow-up :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 in review</title><link>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/2024-in-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/2024-in-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I considered writing a follow-up for &lt;a href="https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/my-time-and-focus-02/">My Time and Focus&lt;/a> posts, titled &amp;laquo;My Time and Focus. 2 years later&amp;raquo;.
I thought I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish writing it in one day, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is what I am writing instead.
It will touch on some of the topics I wanted to bring up, but won&amp;rsquo;t go into as much detail.
This is a spontaneous decision, I am doing it instead of other plans.
But today is a holiday, so I am fine with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Time and Focus. Part 2: But how?</title><link>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/my-time-and-focus-02/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/my-time-and-focus-02/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://www.ftvkyo.me/img/post/my-time-and-focus-02/reintroduction.svg"

&lt;h2 id="reintroduction">Reintroduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/my-time-and-focus-01/">previous part&lt;/a> I have gone through some tools and approaches to self-organisation.
The main focus was on note-taking, and now it is finally time to highlight some neat parts of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have already more-or-less described the criteria that I want the note-taking system to satisfy, and why I need it, so here I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about its &lt;strong>implementation details&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Time and Focus.

&lt;/figure>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The purpose of this series of posts is to share some details of my journey of organizing myself.
I think this might be interesting or even useful for somebody, but I am mostly writing this to stay motivated to continue (and as writing practice).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll start by explaining the problems I&amp;rsquo;m trying to solve and why they matter.
Along the way, I might learn new things or find some insights I missed in the past.
In other words, I want to begin by describing things I already understand, and after that, I would like to continue the series by making &amp;laquo;progress updates&amp;raquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
