&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/my-time-and-focus-01/">previous part&lt;/a> I have gone through some tools and approaches to self-organisation.
The main focus was on note-taking, and now it is finally time to highlight some neat parts of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have already more-or-less described the criteria that I want the note-taking system to satisfy, and why I need it, so here I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about its &lt;strong>implementation details&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Time and Focus.

&lt;p>The purpose of this series of posts is to share some details of my journey of organizing myself.
I think this might be interesting or even useful for somebody, but I am mostly writing this to stay motivated to continue (and as writing practice).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll start by explaining the problems I&amp;rsquo;m trying to solve and why they matter.
Along the way, I might learn new things or find some insights I missed in the past.
In other words, I want to begin by describing things I already understand, and after that, I would like to continue the series by making &amp;laquo;progress updates&amp;raquo;.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
