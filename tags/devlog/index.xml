It had many interesting things to see and cool people to meet.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I made new friends there, but I did get closer to members of &lt;a href="https://wiki.ehlab.uk">Edinburgh Hacklab&lt;/a> which I am also a member of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is not about EMF Camp though, it is about one of its highlights: the &lt;a href="https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/">Tildagon&lt;/a> badge.
These badges are electronic devices that are meant to be extended and modified, this is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker&lt;/a> festival after all.
The badges could be preordered for 25Â£.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hovert60 keyboard devlog #2: Design</title><link>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/devlog-hovert60-02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/devlog-hovert60-02/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/devlog-hovert60-01/">previous post&lt;/a> on the topic, I introcuded my new project: making a personalized mechanical keyboard from scratch.
I described my criteria for the end result and showed you the components I intend to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is focused on the design process of the project.
The posts are sequential, but in reality they go hand-in-hand.
The design influences which components can be used.
Availability, price and properties of the components influence the design.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hovert60 keyboard devlog #1: Init</title><link>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/devlog-hovert60-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/devlog-hovert60-01/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have been a mild fan of mechanical and &lt;a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Ergonomic_keyboard">ergonomic&lt;/a> keyboards for a while now.
I have used &lt;a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ&lt;/a>, Planck EZ &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and &lt;a href="https://drop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard">OLKB Preonic&lt;/a>.
Additionally, my XKB configuration is somewhat interesting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You see, Russian alphabet has 33 letters, while English only has 26.
This means that on the default Russian layout more keys are used for letters, and punctuation keys are different from the US layout.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Parentheses programming language devlog #1: getting to LLVM IR emission</title><link>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/devlog-parentheses-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 21:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/devlog-parentheses-01/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="pre-intro">Pre-intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I start these series hoping to continue them along with the development of
the project this devlog is related to.
Not only the project is an excercise for me, but the devlog itself is as well.
I think about making some games in the future, and how could I make a good
game without having a devlog about it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, thanks to all the advice from different people who suggested some better
techniques of dealing with challenges I face in this project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
