It had many interesting things to see and cool people to meet.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I made new friends there, but I did get closer to members of &lt;a href="https://wiki.ehlab.uk">Edinburgh Hacklab&lt;/a> which I am also a member of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is not about EMF Camp though, it is about one of its highlights: the &lt;a href="https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/">Tildagon&lt;/a> badge.
These badges are electronic devices that are meant to be extended and modified, this is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker&lt;/a> festival after all.
The badges could be preordered for 25Â£.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
