There are many good things about that post.
I reviewed it a few times throughout the year, curious about the changes in my mental state since then and about the goals I had set.
It has also been fun to share it with my friends and acquaintances.
And, most importantly, it presented a good opportunity for reflection at the time of writing.
So, here I am, writing a follow-up :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 in review</title><link>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/2024-in-review/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/2024-in-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I considered writing a follow-up for &lt;a href="https://www.ftvkyo.me/post/my-time-and-focus-02/">My Time and Focus&lt;/a> posts, titled &amp;laquo;My Time and Focus. 2 years later&amp;raquo;.
I thought I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish writing it in one day, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is what I am writing instead.
It will touch on some of the topics I wanted to bring up, but won&amp;rsquo;t go into as much detail.
This is a spontaneous decision, I am doing it instead of other plans.
But today is a holiday, so I am fine with it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
