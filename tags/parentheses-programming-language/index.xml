&lt;p>I start these series hoping to continue them along with the development of
the project this devlog is related to.
Not only the project is an excercise for me, but the devlog itself is as well.
I think about making some games in the future, and how could I make a good
game without having a devlog about it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, thanks to all the advice from different people who suggested some better
techniques of dealing with challenges I face in this project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
