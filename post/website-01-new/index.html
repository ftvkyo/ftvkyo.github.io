Website</a></div></div><p>Anybody here?</p><p>I got this thought to make my website a very long time ago. A classic
idea for a developer, right? However, I could never finish its creation.
For a long time, I had some random pages dangling on my domain.</p><p>I always wanted to put something interesting there, and as I never truly
needed a website, I just played with different things abandoning them later.</p><p>Only two attempts were notable. One where I made it work, with some pages
and even some interactivity, but it all was weird, as I started trying out
some unrelated ideas. &#171;What if I use Python for boring content serving and Rust
for a quick API?&#187; (not that I needed this API). I managed to make it work,
it was running in Docker for quite a while, but it had zero useful
content and almost no value except the experience I got from it.</p><p>Another attempt was less successful. &#171;Docker is boring, I wanna learn DevOps
and put it in Kubernetes&#187;. Well, I managed to run k3s on the server, even make
a container inside of it that would assemble other containers according to
their build instructions and then put them inside a container registry that
was running in the same cluster! Wow, that was cool. I also got this website
template working (that you see now). However, by the time I got to
implementing auto-deployment and stuff, I was too tired to continue.</p><p>Well, and now, I have finally&mldr; just launched that existing template on
Github Pages. Probably, I should learn to build MVP first, haha.</p><p>There was Google Analytics enabled, but I&rsquo;ve replaced it with
<a href=https://plausible.io>Plausible.io</a>. I only need it to see how well my posts
are doing to improve them.</p><p>I have some projects in mind, and I&rsquo;d like to share them with people.
I already have a telegram channel, but I don&rsquo;t want to overload it with too
geeky stuff, so I&rsquo;ll probably leave some more or less technical posts for
this place.</p><p>Thanks for reading, Bye!</p></main><footer class=only-screen>Â© Rei</footer></body></html>
