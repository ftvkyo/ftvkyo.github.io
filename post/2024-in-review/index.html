I thought I couldn&rsquo;t finish writing it in one day, so I didn&rsquo;t start.</p><p>This post is what I am writing instead.
It will touch on some of the topics I wanted to bring up, but won&rsquo;t go into as much detail.
This is a spontaneous decision, I am doing it instead of other plans.
But today is a holiday, so I am fine with it.</p><p>I have a bunch of thoughts that are floating around and waiting to be formulated and refined.
I am using this post as a tool for reflection &ndash; both the process and the end result are valuable.
As a side-effect, this may also end up being interesting to other people 🤷</p><h2 id=key-events-of-2024>Key events of 2024</h2><p>2024 has been an eventful year, full of stuff that was new to me.</p><ul><li>In February, I went on a third leg of a camping trip along the Pennine Way<ul><li>It was extremely wet, and it decreased my desire to go again 😥</li></ul></li><li>In March, I went to Serbia to see my mother and an old friend<ul><li>I haven&rsquo;t seen them in person since October 2019</li></ul></li><li>In April, I joined <a href=https://wiki.ehlab.uk>Edinburgh Hacklab</a><ul><li>At the end of May, I went to <a href=https://emfcamp.org>EMF Camp 2024</a>, I got a ticket from a colleague that sadly could not go</li><li>I wrote a post about the EMF Camp Tildagon badge: <a href=/post/tildagon-known-error/>Making a &#171;Known Error&#187; app for Tildagon</a></li><li>I made a keyboard and wrote posts about it (but didn&rsquo;t finish the series): <a href=/post/devlog-hovert60-01/>Hovert60 Init</a>, <a href=/post/devlog-hovert60-02/>Hovert60 Design</a></li><li>For the keyboard, I made a simple generator of ZMK keymaps that also generates SVG refcards from the same source: <a href=/project/lazy-keymap/>Lazy keymap</a></li><li>I made a simple <a href=/project/milling/>calculator for milling speeds and feeds</a></li><li>I sewed curtains for my living room using an industrial sewing machine</li></ul></li><li>In April, ADHD medication supply issues that lasted half a year were resolved, and I was able to come back to medication that worked well</li><li>Throughout spring and summer I saw a bunch of friends I hadn&rsquo;t seen for a long time and made new friends</li><li>Mid-July, my company released <a href=https://docs.scale-lang.com>SCALE</a> which was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40970560">met with great interest</a><ul><li>My contributions have been interesting and valuable</li></ul></li><li>In August, I celebrated turning 25, a lot of guests visited me</li><li>In August I acquired a 3D-printer, learned <a href=https://openscad.org/>OpenSCAD</a> <em>(pain.jpg)</em> and made a lot of models: <a href=https://github.com/ftvkyo/openscad>GitHub: ftvkyo/openscad</a><ul><li>I did some cursed things with OpenSCAD &ndash; see my <a href=/project/openscad-snippets/>OpenSCAD snippets</a></li></ul></li><li>In December, I solved 16.5 days of <a href=https://adventofcode.com/2024>Advent of Code 2024</a> in OCaml: <a href=https://github.com/ftvkyo/aoc>GitHub: ftvkyo/aoc</a></li><li>Throughout the year, I made some small changes to my <a href=/project/obsidian-ftvkyo/>Obsidian plugin</a></li><li>Throughout the year, I made a lot of style changes on this website</li><li>I published a collection of floorplan drawings of places I lived in: <a href=/project/floorplans/>Floorplans</a></li><li>I played a bit with E-ink displays, with ESP32 C6 using Rust, and with <a href=https://flutter.dev>Flutter</a></li><li>I played ~130 hours of Factorio: Space Age</li><li>I started antidepressants and made significant progress fighting depression, anxiety, burnout and sleep issues</li></ul><p>I will come back to some of these in more detail 🙂</p><aside><p>Note to self: writing and editing up to here took roughly 1 hour 15 minutes.
Time for a break.</p><p><em>*Checks if McDonalds is open on the Boxing Day.*</em></p></aside><h2 id=what-makes-2024-different>What makes 2024 different</h2><p>Honestly, I am surprised by the sheer volume of the previous section, even though I must&rsquo;ve missed something!
It is encouraging.</p><p>Since the early 2023, one of my background goals has been to learn accepting &#171;good enough&#187; as a way to overcome perfectionism.
I&rsquo;d say that cumulative effort from working on that and some other goals is one of the reasons why I was able to get this far.</p><p>The other reason is&mldr; people.</p><p>This year I made a lot of friends and also noticed some of my existing friendships getting stronger.
I met some of the new friends at Edinburgh Hacklab.
I am grateful for having so many people about whom I care and who care about me.</p><p>In the previous two years in Edinburgh I felt somewhat isolated &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t know where and how I could meet people, and my attempts were not very successful.
It was especially difficult as I was trying to &#171;stay afloat&#187; in life, feeling depleted all the time, and struggling to find a way to change anything.</p><aside><p>Note to self: it&rsquo;s so hard to connect the paragraphs and arrive from point A to point B while also avoiding unnecessary detail!
Not to mention, the exact formulation of &#171;where I am going&#187; often depends on the leading text, which means &ndash; <em>I don&rsquo;t know where I am going!</em>
This is a chicken-or-egg problem, and I guess I have to:</p><ol><li>List out all the theses</li><li>Merge & reduce iteratively</li></ol><p>This is nothing new, but specifying the problem precisely made me happy.</p></aside><h3 id=such-is-existence>Such is existence</h3><p>1.5 years ago, I started taking ADHD medication.
It was immensely helpful, as it unlocked more ways for me to control what was going on.
However, I struggled making it sustainable long-term.
I see it this way: the medication allows utilising more resources of the organism, allows overriding some behaviours, but it doesn&rsquo;t inherently increase the amount of said resources.</p><p>I think this is why it is so important to use multiple methods to work with ADHD.
The medication <em>may</em> just help on its own, but in many cases it won&rsquo;t be enough.
Likewise, therapy <em>may</em> be enough on its own to find healthy ways to cope and reach the &#171;stable plateau&#187;, but often it won&rsquo;t suffice.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve come a long way in these 1.5 years.</p><ul><li>My sleep schedule became consistent</li><li>Headaches stopped being a big concern</li><li>I greatly reduced how much I cringe from random memories (among other things)</li><li>I stabilised some important habits and the general structure of the day</li><li>I improved my planning and executive skills</li><li>I put extra effort into socialising</li><li>I think my work output has improved significantly</li></ul><p>From the <a href=/post/my-time-and-focus-02/>My Time and Focus</a> posts you may infer that I have been continuously working on improving my time and task management skills.
When writing those posts, I was worried about their interpretation &ndash; as I don&rsquo;t like &#171;productivity&#187; just for the sake of it.
I focus on it so much because I feel like I have no other choice, really.</p><p>Over time, I found an approach to daily planning that works for me, and later found a way to plan my weeks.
I even tried planning months and setting goals for quarters, but there was too much in the way for that.
I also felt like there was a lot in the way of my desire to take and review notes for journaling and learning new stuff.</p><p>Despite the <strong>huge</strong> improvements of the last 1.5 years, this time has been challenging.
It was as if I had run out of options, and yet the changes were insufficient.
In short:</p><ul><li>I could relate to most of the <a href=https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/symptoms/>symptoms of depression</a><ul><li>I could also relate to the descriptions of burnout and general/social anxiety</li></ul></li><li>I felt like my fate depends on things I found difficult to control</li><li>Most of the days I felt like I had to deal with more stuff than I could handle, including things that were supposed to help me</li><li>I constantly felt exhausted, I struggled to rest & relax</li></ul><aside><p>Some of these things have been with me ever since university, some can be traced even further.
I find it a bit surreal, as certain aspects of them felt so normal that it was hard to recognise their existence.</p><p>I am being rather vague here, and the reason is &ndash; this needs more introspection, and here and now are not the place and time for that.</p><p>My statements may seem exagerrated.
Perhaps I hid it well, or maybe my memory does not serve me right.
I take those possibilities into account when writing and do my best to avoid making unreasonable assumptions.
Definitive answers are not reached easily.</p></aside><p>A bit over a month ago I started taking antidepressants.
Short-term, it feels like it may be the missing puzzle piece for achieving net positive existence!
Nevertheless, it is too early to know what it&rsquo;s going to be like long-term, so I am cautious.</p><p>I have been sleeping slightly better.
I have been feeling like I have more time and energy in my days.
I have been enjoying video games again.
I managed to combine doing work, solving Advent of Code and playing Factorio.
I even surprised my friend by agreeing to go to a parkrun with him, lol.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to take the positive changes for granted.
I also don&rsquo;t want to risk wasting the opportunity to improve things.
In other words &ndash; the work is not over, but I am looking forward to it.</p><h2 id=what-i-want-from-2025>What I want from 2025</h2><p>With the additional energy and time unlocked, I can target some things that I find important, but that were not available to me.
I guess there are two main groups of goals for 2025.
One is &#171;please fix it because how else&#187;, and the other one is &#171;yay projects&#187; 😛</p><h3 id=please-fix-because-how-else>&#171;please fix because how else&#187;</h3><p>I want to be more mindful of on what I spend my time and energy, and how exactly I do it.
This is about deciding what is worth my time, about focusing on it deeply, and about switching off when its time is over.
Crucially, this is also about having proper rest.
Inevitably I will have to find &#171;workarounds&#187; to come up with an ADHD-compatible solution for this.</p><p>I want to get better at utilising the state of flow.
It is quite spontaneous, and often it is also when I do my best work.
I need to make it more comfortable and safe to enter the flow and to stay in it for longer.
I noticed that without that, sometimes I can&rsquo;t allow to give up the control and sacrifice something that the flow would &#171;eat&#187;.</p><p>I want to improve my long-term planning.
I think that at the moment there are three blockers for that:</p><ol><li>I need to remember that said long-term goals exist and take them into account when planning short-term</li><li>I need to think of concrete steps I can take to approach said goals</li><li>I need to review the progress and reflect regularly</li></ol><aside><p>I am currently slowly working on these.
I think the difficult part is that all of these, even at the very least, require quite a lot of effort.
So I haven&rsquo;t previously been able to bridge that gap.</p><p>The funny thing is that &#171;improving long-term planning&#187; is a long-term goal itself.
Chicken-or-egg yet again.</p></aside><h3 id=yay-projects>&#171;yay projects&#187;</h3><p>Most importantly: keep doing my best at treating others with respect and kindness, even in challenging situations.</p><p>I also want to:</p><ul><li>Reduce back and neck pain and generally further improve my physical health</li><li>Make consistent progress in work, projects and learning</li><li>Learn the basics of making music, could be digital or with an instrument</li><li>Close, clean up some old projects / tasks / ideas that stopped being relevant</li><li>Improve my interactions with the computer<ul><li>Make a keyboard that I will actually use</li><li>Improve my usage of keyboard shortcuts</li><li>Make another attempt at migrating to Colemak Mod-DH</li></ul></li><li>Play 200 more hours of Factorio</li><li>Finish Elden Ring DLC</li><li>Update my approach to journaling, learning and reviewing notes to make those come naturally</li><li>Write</li></ul><h2 id=thank-you>Thank you</h2><p>I mentioned that the people is one of the things that made 2024 so different.
I want to thank all the people that provided support, advice, listened to me and simply existed (in no particular order).</p><p>Thank you Mom, Alla and Oleg.</p><p>Thank you Mel, Artem, Taylor, Dylan, Chris, Miron, Syvl, Ilya, Nina, Emily, Blake, River, Soph, Jules, Yara, Eugene, Vanessa, Edinburgh Hacklab and others.</p><p>You made my year.</p><p>Happy holidays! ☃️</p></main><footer class=only-screen>© Rei</footer></body></html>
