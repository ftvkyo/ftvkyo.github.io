I was not satisfied with the original theme (<a href=https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cayman-hugo-theme>Cayman</a>) and wanted to change it.
The problem was not in the look of the theme, but in how much tweaking I wanted to do, so it was easier to just make a new theme of my own.</p><p>I have also changed the way the website is built.
I used to have the website sources in a public Github repository and the deployments were done with a Github Action, to a <code>gh-pages</code> branch in the same repo.
I have moved the sources of the website to a separate repository and the deployments are set up to update <code>gh-pages</code> in the original repository.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look into the details.</p><h2 id=presentation-changes>Presentation changes</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t use any component libraries for styling.
I have written some SCSS and I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with its structure.
There are still some tweaks I want to make.
In particular, although I have already done some <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantic_elements>Semantic HTML</a>-ing, I want to go even further on accessbility.</p><h3 id=language-selection>Language selection</h3><p>I implemented a menu for language selection, you can see it in the top-left corner (if I haven&rsquo;t removed it by the time you read this).
The language selector uses JavaScript.
Implementing a <code>noscript</code> fallback is one of the things I might do later.</p><p>Currently available languages are, as before, English and Russian.
I write for English first, and then (sometimes) translate it to Russian.</p><h3 id=themes>Themes</h3><p>I also plan to add a selector for website themes, it will be next to the language menu.
Themes I want to implement are:</p><ul><li>System default</li><li>Light</li><li>Dark</li><li>High contrast (possibly also split into light and dark)</li></ul><p>Currently, most of the colors used are <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color>named colors</a>, and the text is <code>black</code>, and the background is <code>white</code>.
This is good for contrast, and for accessibility, but this is not something that I personally like to see, so I plan to create a &#171;prettier&#187; default theme and move the current one to &#171;high contrast&#187;.</p><h2 id=build-changes>Build changes</h2><p>The move of the website sources to a separate repository was done for two reasons:</p><ul><li>I wanted to be able to work on new content without having to worry about people reading the unfinished drafts.</li><li>I didn&rsquo;t want to store the website version history publicly.
This, of course, can be circumvented, but the current solution is enough for me.</li></ul><p>Luckily, the Github Action I was already using for deployments (<a href=https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages</a>) supports both deploying to a separate repository and creating an orphan branch on every deployment.</p><p>Because of me playing with SCSS, I also had to add a step to install <code>dart-sass-embedded</code> to the Github Action.</p><h2 id=further-plans>Further plans</h2><ul><li>Accesibility improvements (readability, semantic HTML, check tab order, aria-labelling, etc.)</li><li>Better colors for the default theme, and a theme selector</li><li>Better non-color-related styling of the posts (e.g. margins, line height, font sizes, etc.)</li><li>New content sections (Projects), cleaning up the existing ones (About me).</li><li>favicon&mldr;</li></ul></main><footer class=only-screen>Â© Rei</footer></body></html>
